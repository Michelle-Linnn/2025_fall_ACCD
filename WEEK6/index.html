<h1>1. Programming Design Systems — Introduction</h1>

<h3>Quote 1</h3>
<p>“We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done.”</p>
<p>This quote highlights a fundamental cultural shift: design is no longer defined by static objects but by dynamic systems and the processes embedded within them. It reframes the designer’s role from crafting isolated artifacts to structuring networks of relationships, interactions, and rules.</p>

<h3>Quote 2</h3>
<p>“Digital products allow users to interact with their content, and take advantage of motion and animation… digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions.”</p>
<p>This statement emphasizes the temporal and interactive nature of digital design. Unlike print, digital products evolve over time and react to user behavior, requiring designers to consider animation, transition states, and user-driven narratives rather than fixed layouts.</p>

<h3>Quote 3</h3>
<p>“History has shown us that systems can cure the fear of the blank canvas, and it is a powerful concept to encode these ideas into actual software.”</p>
<p>Here, systems are portrayed not as constraints but as creative enablers. By establishing structured systems—whether visual rules, algorithms, or generative tools—designers can overcome creative paralysis and unlock a more exploratory, iterative design process.</p>


<h1>2. What Do Prototypes Prototype? — Houde & Hill</h1>

<h3>Quote 1</h3>
<p>“Choosing the right kind of more focused prototype to build is an art in itself, and communicating its limited purposes to its various audiences is a critical aspect of its use.”</p>
<p>This quote reveals that prototypes are strategic tools, not miniature products. Designers must carefully choose what aspect—role, look and feel, or implementation—they aim to explore, and must clearly communicate what the prototype does not represent to avoid misinterpretation.</p>

<h3>Quote 2</h3>
<p>“Such terms can be distracting… detail is not a sure indicator of completeness.”</p>
<p>The authors challenge the conventional obsession with fidelity. A visually polished prototype may still fail to address the real design problem. This reminds us that fidelity is not about appearance but about how effectively a prototype supports learning and decision-making.</p>

<h3>Quote 3</h3>
<p>“What is significant is not what media or tools were used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.”</p>
<p>This final quote underscores that prototypes are defined by their purpose, not their medium. Whether paper, code, or video, the value lies in how the prototype helps designers test ideas, reveal uncertainties, and refine their understanding of the final product.</p>
